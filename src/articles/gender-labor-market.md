# Gender Labor Market Vulnerability in Pakistan: A Comprehensive Analysis Through Global Shock Eras (1991-2024) 

### An empirical examination of gendered labor market disparities using World Bank data 

---

## Executive Summary
This analysis presents a novel Gender Labor Market Vulnerability Index for Pakistan, constructed using principal component analysis of seven key labor market indicators spanning 1991-2024 . The findings reveal a disturbing upward trajectory in gender-based vulnerability, with the index deteriorating from -2.82 in 1991 to 4.00 in 2024—a total shift of 6.82 standard deviations .

The COVID-19 pandemic emerges as the most devastating shock for gender equity in Pakistan’s labor market, far surpassing the impact of the 2008 financial crisis or the post-9/11 period . While female labor force participation has nearly doubled from 16.7% to 30.2% of male participation rates, this modest progress masks deepening structural inequalities in employment quality, vulnerability, and youth unemployment .

## Methodology

### Index Construction
The Gender Labor Market Vulnerability Index employs principal component analysis (PCA) to distill seven gender-gap indicators into a single composite measure . This approach captures 70.3% of the total variance in the underlying data, providing a robust aggregate measure of labor market gender inequality .

**Component Indicators:** 
1.  **Labor Force Participation Rate Gap** (Female/Male ratio) - Loading: 0.424
2.  **Employment-to-Population Ratio Gap** (Female/Male ratio) - Loading: 0.417
3.  **Unemployment Rate Gap** (Female minus Male, percentage points) - Loading: 0.393
4.  **Youth Unemployment Gap** (Female minus Male, percentage points) - Loading: 0.203
5.  **Vulnerable Employment Gap** (Female minus Male, percentage points) - Loading: 0.386
6.  **Intermediate Education Labor Force Gap** (Female/Male ratio) - Loading: 0.360
7.  **Advanced Education Labor Force Gap** (Female/Male ratio) - Loading: 0.415

The first principal component (PC1) accounts for over 70% of variance, with all indicators loading positively . Higher values indicate greater gender vulnerability, meaning wider gaps favoring male labor market outcomes .

### Data Source and Period Selection
All data are sourced from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators, utilizing modeled International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates for consistency and comparability . The analysis period (1991-2024) encompasses three major global shock periods:
* **9/11 and War on Terror** (2001-2003) 
* **Global Financial Crisis** (2007-2009) 
* **COVID-19 Pandemic** (2019-2021) 

These shock periods serve as natural experiments to assess how systemic crises differentially impact male and female labor market outcomes in Pakistan’s context .

## Key Findings

### 1. Accelerating Gender Vulnerability
The Gender Labor Market Vulnerability Index has risen from -2.82 in 1991 to 4.00 in 2024, representing a 142% deterioration . This trend contradicts the narrative of linear progress in gender equality . The index remained relatively stable (below 0) from 1991 through 2005, suggesting the early 1990s through mid-2000s represented Pakistan’s best period for relative gender parity in labor markets .

**Critical Inflection Points:** 
* **2006-2007:** The index crossed zero, marking a permanent shift toward heightened vulnerability.
* **2012:** A spike to 3.2 coincided with economic turbulence and rising unemployment across both genders, though women were disproportionately affected.
* **2015:** Another dramatic spike to 3.3, potentially linked to the aftermath of the 2013 general elections and subsequent economic policy shifts.
* **2020-2021:** The COVID-19 period pushed the index to its all-time high of 4.28, from which it has not recovered.

### 2. Shock Period Analysis: COVID-19 as an Unprecedented Setback
Comparing the three major shock periods reveals stark differences in their impact on gender vulnerability:

* **9/11 and War on Terror (2001-2003):** Average index: -1.98 (still in negative/better territory). Change: +0.29 (modest deterioration). Impact: Relatively contained; Pakistan’s labor markets showed resilience .
* **2008 Financial Crisis (2007-2009):** Average index: +0.22 (recently turned positive). Change: +0.30 (similar magnitude to 9/11 period). Impact: Marked the transition from improving to worsening gender gaps .
* **COVID-19 Pandemic (2019-2021):** Average index: +2.75 (severely elevated). Change: +2.14 (over 7x larger than previous shocks). Impact: Catastrophic for gender equality; women bore a massively disproportionate burden .

The COVID-19 shock was not merely more severe but categorically different in nature . The 2.14-point increase in the vulnerability index during 2019-2021 dwarfs the combined impact of the two previous crises . This suggests that pandemic-related lockdowns, school closures, and healthcare burdens fell disproportionately on women, forcing many out of already precarious employment .

### 3. Labor Force Participation: Progress Without Parity
Female labor force participation relative to male participation has improved from 16.7% in 1991 to 30.2% in 2024 . While this represents an 81% increase, it simultaneously reveals that even in 2024, women participate in Pakistan’s formal labor market at less than one-third the rate of men .

* **Regional Context:** Pakistan’s female labor force participation rate of approximately 24% (2024) remains among the lowest globally . For comparison, Bangladesh—a country with similar cultural and economic characteristics—has achieved rates exceeding 35% .
* **Structural Barriers:** This persistent gap cannot be attributed solely to cultural factors but reflects structural barriers including limited access to childcare infrastructure, gender-segregated employment sectors, safety concerns, and legal barriers to entrepreneurship .

The employment-to-population ratio shows a similar pattern, with the female-to-male ratio improving from 16.8% to 29.4% . The near-perfect correlation between participation and employment ratios indicates that women who seek work are approximately as likely as men to find it—the primary barrier is entry into the labor force itself, not discrimination in hiring once actively seeking employment .

### 4. Unemployment Gaps: A Recent Phenomenon
Until 2007, unemployment rates were nearly identical for men and women, often with female rates marginally lower . This changed dramatically post-2008, with the female unemployment gap becoming persistently positive (higher female unemployment) .

* **Youth Unemployment Crisis:** The youth unemployment gap (ages 15-24) is particularly alarming, reaching 4.5 percentage points in 2020, meaning young women faced unemployment rates 4.5 points higher than young men . This has profound implications for lost human capital accumulation and discouraged labor force exit .

The 2020 spike to 9.5 percentage points for the general female unemployment gap and 14.4 points for youth is unprecedented in the dataset and suggests that pandemic-related job losses were heavily concentrated among women, particularly young women in entry-level positions .

### 5. Vulnerable Employment: A Persistent and Widening Gap
Vulnerable employment—defined as own-account workers and contributing family workers without formal employment contracts or social protection—represents one of the most concerning trends . The gap between female and vulnerable employment rates has widened from 9.97 percentage points in 1991 to 22.72 percentage points in 2024, a 128% increase .

* **Structural Interpretation:** In 2024, nearly three-quarters (73.3%) of employed women work in vulnerable employment, compared to 50.6% of men . This means women disproportionately lack access to benefits and legal protections, and economic shocks hit women harder .

The vulnerable employment gap briefly narrowed during 2000-2007, reaching a low of 3.2 percentage points in 2002 . However, post-2007, the gap has expanded consistently, crossing 20 percentage points in 2015 and remaining elevated since . This suggests that Pakistan’s recent economic growth has been “unequalizing”—generating employment opportunities that are either inaccessible to women or of significantly lower quality when women access them .

### 6. Education Gaps: Rising Educational Attainment, Persistent Labor Market Exclusion
The most paradoxical finding emerges from educational indicators. Women’s representation in the labor force with advanced education has surged from 21.1% of men’s levels in 1991 to 62.0% in 2024 .

* **The Education-Employment Paradox:** Despite near-doubling of highly educated women in the labor force, the overall vulnerability index has worsened . This indicates that educational attainment is necessary but insufficient for labor market equality, and demand-side barriers remain binding constraints .

The striking divergence between rising educational parity and rising labor market vulnerability suggests that Pakistan faces an emerging crisis of overqualified, underemployed women . The social and political implications are significant, as educated women with thwarted economic ambitions may become increasingly vocal advocates for structural reform .

## Sub-Index Analysis: Differential Trends by Gender
The decomposition into separate male and female labor market sub-indexes reveals divergent trajectories:

* **Female Labor Market Sub-Index:** Shows strong upward trajectory from -0.8 (1991) to +1.2 (2024). Indicates improving female labor market outcomes in absolute terms (rising participation, employment, education) but is vulnerable to sharp negative spikes during crises (2008, 2015, 2020) .
* **Male Labor Market Sub-Index:** Shows downward trajectory from +0.45 (1991) to +0.15 (2024). Indicates deteriorating male labor market outcomes in absolute terms and is more stable during crisis periods compared to the female index .

**Interpretation:** Both men and women in Pakistan have faced challenging labor market conditions, but women’s outcomes have improved from a much lower base while remaining highly volatile . Men’s outcomes have gradually worsened, potentially reflecting broader economic stagnation . The widening vulnerability gap, therefore, reflects not female deterioration but female improvement that is insufficient to close historical gaps, combined with differential crisis impacts .

## Policy Implications

1.  **Crisis-Proofing Women’s Employment:** The massively disproportionate impact of COVID-19 demands policy attention to crisis resilience, including formal employment incentives, childcare infrastructure, and unemployment insurance extended to informal workers .
2.  **Addressing the Vulnerable Employment Crisis:** With nearly three-quarters of employed women in vulnerable positions, policies should focus on formalization programs, social protection extension, and skills training aligned with formal sector demand .
3.  **Translating Education into Employment:** To address the education-employment paradox, interventions should include anti-discrimination enforcement, quotas and targets in public sector hiring, and workplace culture reform .
4.  **Youth Unemployment as a Strategic Priority:** The youth unemployment gap represents a generational setback. Solutions include first job programs, apprenticeships beyond traditional "female" sectors, and entrepreneurship support .
5.  **Data-Driven Monitoring and Accountability:** Institutionalize regular index updates, extend analysis to the provincial level, and develop real-time monitoring for shock preparedness .

## Limitations and Future Research
This analysis has several limitations that suggest directions for future research:
* **Sectoral Analysis Absent:** The aggregate index masks sectoral variation; decomposition could identify where interventions have the highest return .
* **Urban-Rural Divide:** National aggregates mask potentially vast urban-rural differences .
* **Causality vs. Correlation:** Rigorous econometric identification strategies could isolate shock effects from confounding trends .
* **Quality of Employment:** Future work should examine wage gaps, hours worked, and occupational segregation .
* **Intersectionality:** Research should examine how multiple marginalized identities compound labor market disadvantage .

## Conclusion
Pakistan’s journey toward gender equality in labor markets has been neither linear nor assured . While female labor force participation has risen and educational attainment has improved dramatically, these gains have been overwhelmed by widening gaps in employment quality, rising unemployment disparities, and catastrophic setbacks during systemic crises—particularly COVID-19 .

The Gender Labor Market Vulnerability Index, having deteriorated by nearly seven standard deviations since 1991, tells a story of lost ground and unrealized potential . Pakistan now faces a critical juncture: absent bold policy interventions, current trajectories suggest continued deterioration . Young, educated women entering a labor market that offers primarily vulnerable employment represent both a wasted resource and a source of future social tension .

However, the data also offer grounds for cautious optimism. The fact that educational gaps are closing rapidly demonstrates that cultural barriers are not immutable . Women are signaling their desire to participate in the formal economy . The challenge for policymakers is to ensure that the economy can absorb this talent productively, equitably, and resiliently . The COVID-19 shock, while devastating, also presents an opportunity to rebuild a labor market that is more inclusive and resilient . The alternative—a return to pre-pandemic trajectories—would represent both an economic loss and a moral failure .
