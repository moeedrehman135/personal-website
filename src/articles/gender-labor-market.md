## Executive Summary

This analysis presents a novel Gender Labor Market Vulnerability Index for Pakistan, constructed using principal component analysis of seven key labor market indicators spanning 1991-2024. The findings reveal a disturbing upward trajectory in gender-based vulnerability, with the index deteriorating from -2.82 in 1991 to 4.00 in 2024—a total shift of 6.82 standard deviations.

The COVID-19 pandemic emerges as the most devastating shock for gender equity in Pakistan's labor market, far surpassing the impact of the 2008 financial crisis or the post-9/11 period. While female labor force participation has nearly doubled from 16.7% to 30.2% of male participation rates, this modest progress masks deepening structural inequalities in employment quality, vulnerability, and youth unemployment.

## Methodology

The Gender Labor Market Vulnerability Index employs principal component analysis (PCA) to distill seven gender-gap indicators into a single composite measure. This approach captures 70.3% of the total variance in the underlying data, providing a robust aggregate measure of labor market gender inequality.

### Component Indicators

- **Labor Force Participation Rate Gap** (Female/Male ratio) - Loading: 0.424
- **Employment-to-Population Ratio Gap** (Female/Male ratio) - Loading: 0.417
- **Unemployment Rate Gap** (Female minus Male, percentage points) - Loading: 0.393
- **Youth Unemployment Gap** (Female minus Male, percentage points) - Loading: 0.203
- **Vulnerable Employment Gap** (Female minus Male, percentage points) - Loading: 0.386
- **Intermediate Education Labor Force Gap** (Female/Male ratio) - Loading: 0.360
- **Advanced Education Labor Force Gap** (Female/Male ratio) - Loading: 0.415

The first principal component (PC1) accounts for over 70% of variance, with all indicators loading positively. Higher values indicate greater gender vulnerability, meaning wider gaps favoring male labor market outcomes.

## Key Findings

The Gender Labor Market Vulnerability Index has risen from -2.82 in 1991 to 4.00 in 2024, representing a 142% deterioration. This trend contradicts the narrative of linear progress in gender equality. The index remained relatively stable (below 0) from 1991 through 2005, suggesting the early 1990s through mid-2000s represented Pakistan's best period for relative gender parity in labor markets.

Critical inflection points emerged in 2006-2007 when the index crossed zero, marking a permanent shift toward heightened vulnerability. The 2012 spike coincided with economic turbulence, while 2015 saw another dramatic spike potentially linked to post-election economic policy shifts. Most catastrophically, the 2020-2021 COVID-19 period pushed the index to its all-time high of 4.28, from which it has not recovered.

## Shock Period Analysis: COVID-19 as an Unprecedented Setback

Comparing the three major shock periods reveals COVID-19's categorically different impact. The 9/11 and War on Terror period showed average index of -1.98 with modest deterioration of +0.29, suggesting Pakistan's labor markets showed resilience. The 2008 Financial Crisis brought the index to average +0.22 with similar magnitude change (+0.30), marking the transition from improving to worsening gender gaps.

COVID-19 stands apart. With an average index of +2.75 and change of +2.14, the pandemic's impact was over 7x larger than previous shocks. This massive difference suggests the nature of the pandemic's impact was fundamentally different—lockdowns, school closures, and healthcare burdens fell disproportionately on women, forcing many out of already precarious employment.

## Key Takeaways

- The Gender Labor Market Vulnerability Index deteriorated by 6.82 standard deviations (1991-2024)
- COVID-19 was 7x more damaging than 2008 financial crisis
- Female labor force participation improved 81% but remains below 31% of male rates
- Nearly 73% of employed women work in vulnerable employment
- Educational progress hasn't translated to labor market gains
- Youth unemployment gaps reached 14.4 percentage points during COVID-19
- Pakistan's female labor participation (24%) is among the lowest globally

## Conclusion

Pakistan's journey toward gender equality in labor markets has been neither linear nor assured. While female labor force participation has risen and educational attainment has improved dramatically, these gains have been overwhelmed by widening gaps in employment quality, rising unemployment disparities, and catastrophic setbacks during systemic crises—particularly COVID-19.

The Gender Labor Market Vulnerability Index, having deteriorated by nearly seven standard deviations since 1991, tells a story of lost ground and unrealized potential. Young, educated women entering a labor market that offers primarily vulnerable employment represent both a wasted resource and a source of future social tension.

However, the data offer grounds for cautious optimism. The fact that educational gaps are closing rapidly demonstrates that cultural barriers are not immutable. Pakistan can choose to rebuild its labor market in ways that are more inclusive, more resilient to future shocks, and more aligned with the aspirations of its female population.
